UK Biobank Actigraphy Anlaysis

A study associating actigraphy (wrist worn accelerometers) data to disease phenotypes in the UK Biobank

This repository contains a Snakemake pipeline to process and aggregate the actigraphy data in the UK Biobank. It then contains scripts (phewas.py) to generate figures and results tables for a phenome-wide association study comparing the actigraphy to phenotypes.
